## Welcome!
We're currently testing CyanDream for various devices. A version for the <i>HTC Desire HD</i> is already available for testing, updates are available our UpdateChecker, a tool that offers OTA updates if the previous version is found on the SD card. We already prepared many CM11 devices for CyanDream, if you have some other devices that we should add to our daily / weekly builds, please contact me via email: kontakt at yanniks dot de. Even if your device does not get official support for CM11, we're happy about every new supported device.

If you'd like to test our ROM before we release it, please contact me via the email address above.


Sincerely,
the CyanDream team
